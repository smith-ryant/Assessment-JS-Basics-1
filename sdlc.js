// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

const softwareLifecycle = 'The Reorganization of steps in the Software Development Life Cycle, aka SDLC, is Planning, Analysis of Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testig & Integration, and Maintaining.' 


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const SDLC = "The software development lifecycle or SDLC  is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and uild hig-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to minimie project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond."

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "The requirement analysis phase of SDLC is important in the software development life cycle process. It is used to identify and define the software. Developers work with stakeolders to determine the requirements of the software. This creates software beneficial to users."

const design = "In the design phase, software engineers analyze requirements and identify the best solutions to create the software. For example, they may consider integrating pre-existinf modules, make technology choices, and identify  development tools. They will look at how to best integrate the new software into any existing IT infrastructure the organization may have."

const implementation = "In the implementation phase, the development team codes the produc. They analyze the requirements to identify smaller coding tasks they can do daily to achieve the final result."

const testingAndIntegration = "The development team combines automation and manual testing to check the software for bugs. Quality analysis includes testing the software for errors and checking if it meets customer requirements. Because many teams immediately test the code they write, the testing phase often runs parallel to the development phase."

const maintain = "In the maintenance phase, among other talks, the team fixes bugs, resolves customer issues, and manages software changes. In addition, the team monitors overall system performance, security, and user experience to identify new ways to improve the existing software."
